    "## Precision/Recall Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this tradeoff, let's look at how the `SGDClassifier` makes it classification decision. For each instance, it computes a score based on a *decision function*, & if that score is greater than a threshold, it assigns the instance to the positive class, or else it assigns it to the negative class. The following figure shows a few digits positioned fromthe lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right. Suppose the *decision threshold* is positioned at the central arrow (between the two 5s): you will find 4 true positives (actual 5s), on the right of tha threshold, & one false positive (actually a 6). Therefore, with that threshold, the precision is 80% (4 out of 5). But out of 6 actual 5s, the classifier only detects 4, so the recall is 67% (4 out of 6). Now if you raise the threhold (move it to the arrow on the right), the false positive (the 6) becomes a true negative, thereby increasing precision (up to 100% in this case), but one true positive becomes a false negative, decreasing recall down to 50%. Conversely, lowering the threhold increases recall & reduces precision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn does not let you set the threshold directly, but it does give you access to the decision scores that it uses to make predictions. Instead of calling the classifier's `predict()` method, you can call its `decision_function()` method, which returns a score for each instance, & then makes predictions based on those scores using any threshold you want."

    "# Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas binary classifiers distinguish between two classes, *multiclass classifiers* (aka. *multinomial classifiers*) can distinguish between more than two class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms (such as random forest classifiers or naive bayes classifiers) are capable of handling multiple classes directly. Others (such as support vector machine classifiers or linear classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are various strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification using multiple binary classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10 class (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a 1-detector, a 2-detector, & so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get the decision score from each classifier for that image & you select the class whose classifier outputs the highest score. This is called the *one-versus-all* (OvA) strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distinguish 0s & 1s another to distinguish 0s & 2s, another for 1s & 2s, & so on. This is called the *one-versus-one* (OvO) strategy. If there are *N* classes, you need to train $\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$ classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45 binary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image through all 45 classifiers & see which class wins the most duels. The main advantage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training set for the two classes that it must distinguish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms (such as support vector machine classifiers) scale poorly with the size of the training set, so for these algorithms, OvO is preferred since it is faster to train many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large training sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvA is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn detects when you try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multiclass classification task, & it automatically runs OvA (except for SVM classifiers for which it uses OvO). Let's try this with the `SGDClassifier`."

Some of the digits that the classifier gets wrong (i.e., in the bottom-left & top-right blocks) are so badly written that even a human would have trouble classifying them (e.g., the 5 on the 1st row & 2nd column truly looks like a badly written 3). However, most misclassified images seem like obvious errors to us, & it's hard to understand why the classifier made the mistakes it did. The reason is that we used a simple `SGDClassifier`, which is a linear model. All it does is assign a weight per class to each pixel, & when it sees a new image i just sums up the weighted mixel intensities to get a score for each class. So since 3s & 5s differ only by a few pixels, this model will easily confuse them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between 3s & 5s is the position of the small line that joins the top line to the bottom arc. If you draw a 3 with the junction slightly shifted to the left, the classifier might classify it as a 5, & vice versa. In other words, this classifier is quite sensitive to image shifting & rotation. So one way to reduce the 3/5 confusion would be to preprocess the images to ensure that they are well centered & not too rotated. This will help reduce other errors as well."

    "Until now, each instance has always been assigned to just one class. In some cases, you may want your classifier to output multiple classes for each instance. For example, consider a face-recognition classifier: what should it do if it recognises several people on the same picture? Of course, it should attach one tag per person it recognises. Say the classifier has some trained to recognise three faces, Alice, Bob & Charlier; then when it is shown a picture of Alice & Charlie, it should output [1, 0, 1] (meaning \"Alice yes, Bob no, Charlie yes\"). Such a classification system that outputs multiple binary tags is called a *multilabel classification system*.\n",
