    "# Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reinforcement Learning* (RL) is one of the most exciting fields of machine learning today, & also one of the oldest. It has been around since the 1950s, producing many interesting applications over the years, particularly in games (e.g., *TD-Gammon*, a backgammon-playing program) & in machine control, but seldom making the headline news. But a revolution took place in 2013, when researchers from a British startup called DeepMind demonstrated a system that could learn to play just about any Atari game from scratch, eventually outperforming humans in most of them, using only raw pixels as inputs & without any prior knowledge of the rules of the games. This was the first of a series of amazing feats, culminating in March 2016 with the victory of their system AlphaGo against Lee Sedol, a legendary professional play of the game of Go, & in May 2017 against Ke Jie, the world champion. No program had ever come close to beating a master of this game, let alone the world champion. Today, the whole field of RL is boiling with new ideas, with a wide range of applications. DeepMind was bought by Google for over 500 million in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did DeepMind achieve all this? With hindsight, it seems rather simple: they applied the power of deep learning to the field of reinforcement learning, & it worked beyond their wildest dreams. In this lesson, we will first explain what reinforcement learning is & what it's good at, then present two of the most important techniques in deep reinforcement learning: *policy gradients* & *deep Q-networks* (DQNs), including a discussion of *Markov decision processes* (MDPs). We will use these techniques to train models to balance a pole on a moving cart; then we'll introduce the tf-agents library, which uses state-of-the-art algorithms that greatly simplify building powerful RL systems, & we will use the library to train an agent to play *Breakout*, the famous Atari game. We'll then close the lesson by taking a look at some of the latest advances in the field."

    "# Learning to Optimise Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, a software *agent* makes *observations* & takes *actions* within an *environment*, & in return, it receives *rewards*. Its objetive is to learn to act in a way that will maximise its expected rewards over time. If you don't mind a bit of anthropomorphism, you can think of positive rewards as pleasure, & negative rewards as pain. In short, the agent acts in the environment & learns by trial & error to maximise its pleasure & minimise its pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a broad setting, which can apply to a wide variety of tasks. Here are a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent can be the program controlling a robot. In this case, the environment is the real world, the agent observes the environment through a set of *sensors* such as cameras & touch sensors, & its actions consist of sending signals to activate motors. It may be programmed to get positive rewards whenever it approaches the target destination, & negative rewards whenever it wastes time or goes in the wrong direction.\n",
    "2. The agent can be the program controlling *Ms. Pac-Man*. In this case, the environment is a simulation of the Atari game, the actions are the nine possible joystick positions (upper left, down, center, & so on), the observations are screenshots, & the rewards are just the game points.\n",
    "3. Similarly, the agent can be the program playing a board game such as Go.\n",
    "4. The agent does not have to control a physically (or virtually) moving thing. For example, it can be a smart thermostat, giving positive rewords whenever it is close to the target temperature & saves energy, & negative rewards when humans need to tweak the temperature, so the agent must learn to anticipate human needs.\n",
    "5. The agent can observe stock market prices & decide how much to buy or sell every second. Rewards are obviously the monetary gains & losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/Reinforcement Learning Examples.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may not be any positive rewards at all; for example, the agent may move around in a maze, getting a negative reward at every time step, so it had better find the exit as quickly as possible! There are many other examples of tasks to which reinforcement learning is well suited, such as self-driving cars, recommender systems, placing ads on a web page, or controlling where an image classification system should focus its attention."

    "# Policy Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm a software agent uses to determine its actions is called its *policy*. The policy can be a neural network taking observations as inputs & outputting the action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/Reinforcement Learning Using NN Policy.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy can be any algorithm you can think of, & it does not have to be deterministic. In fact, in some cases, it does not even have to observe the environment! For example, consider a robotic vacuum cleaner whose reward is the amount of dust it picks up in 30 minutes. Its policy could be to move forward with some probability *p* every second, or randomly rotate left or right with probability 1 - *p*. The rotation angle would be a random angle between -r & +r. Since this policy involves some randomness, it is called a *stochastic policy*. The robot will have an erratic trajectory, which guarantees that it will eventually get to any place it can reach & pick up all the dust. The question is, how much dust will it pick up in 30 minutes?\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you train such a robot? There are just two *policy parameters* you can tweak: the probability *p* & the angle range *r*. One possible learning algorithm could be to try out many different values for these parameters, & pick the combination that performs best.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/Policy Search.png\" width = \"550\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of *policy search*, in this case using a brute force approach. When the *policy space* is too large, (which is generally the case), finding a good set of hyperparameters this way is like searching for a needle in a gigantic haystack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to explore the policy is to use *genetic algorithms*. For example, you could randomly create a first generation of 100 policies & try them out, then \"kill\"\" the 80 worst policies & make the 20 survivors produce 4 offspring each. An offspring is a copy of its parent plus suome random variation. The surviving policies plus their offspring together constitute the second generation. You can continue to iterate through generations this way until you find a good policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another approach is to use optimisation techniques, by evaluating the gradients of the rewards with regard to the policy parameters, then tweaking these parameters by following the gradients toward higher rewards. We will discuss this appraoch, *policy gradients* (PG), in more detail later in this lesson. Going back to the vacuum cleaner robot, you could slightly increase *p* & evaluate whether doing so increases the amount of dust picked up by the robot in 30 minutes; if it does, then increase *p* some more, or else reduce *p*. We will implement a popular PG algorithm using TensorFlow, but before we do, we need to create an environment for the agent to live in -- so it's time to introduce OpenAI Gym."

    "# Introduction to OpenAI Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of reinforcement learning is that in order to train an agent, you first need to have a working environment. If you want to program an agent that will learn to play an Atari game, you will need an Atari game simulator. If you want to program a walking robot, then the environment is the real world, & you can directly train your robot in that environment, but it has its limits: if the robot falls off a cliff,you can't just click Undo. You can't speed up training either; adding computing power won't make your robot move any faster. It's generally too expensive to train 1,000 robots in parallel too. In short, training is hard & slow in the real world, so you generally need a *simulated environment* at least for bootstrap training. For example, you may use a library like pybullet or mujoco for 3D physics simulation.\n",
    "\n",

Here's an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, & all the dishes look equally appealing, so you randomly pick one.

It would just be regular supervised learning. However, in reinforcement learning, the only guidance the agent gets is through rewards, & rewards are typically sparse & delayed. For example, if the agent manages to balance the pole for 100 steps, how can it know which of the 100 actions it took were good, & which of them were bad? All it knows is that the pole fell after the last action, but surely the last action is not entirely responsible. This is calledthe *credit assignment problem*: when the agent gets a reward, it is hard for it to know which actions should get credited (or blamed) for it. Think of a dog that gets rewarded hours after it behaved well; will it understand what it is being rewarded for?\n",

    "If an agent decides to go right three time in a row & gets +10 reward after the first step, 0 after the second step, & finally - 50 after the third step, then assumming we use a discount factor $\\gamma = 0.8$, the first action will have a return of $10 + \\gamma * 0 + \\gamma^2 * (-50) = -22$. If the discount factor is close to 0, then future rewards won't count for much compared to immediate rewards. Conversely, if the discount factor is close to 1, then rewards far into the future will count almost as much as immediate rewards. Typical discount factors vary from 0.9 to 0.99. With a discount factor of 0.95, rewards 13 steps into the future count roughly for half as much as immediate rewards (since $0.95^{13} \\approx 0.5$), while the with a discount factor of 0.99, rewards 69 steps into the future count for half as much as immediate rewards. In the cartpole environment, actions have fairly short-term effects, so choosing a discount of 0.95 seems reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a good action may be followed by several bad actions that cause the pole to fall quickly, resulting in the good action getting a low return (similarly, a good actor may sometimes star in a terrible movie). However, if we play the game enough times, on average, good actions will get a higher return than bad ones. We want to play estimate how much better or worse an action is, compared to the other possible actions, on average. This is called the *action advantage*. For this, we must run many episodes & normalise all the action returns (by subtracting the mean & dividing by the standard deviation). After that, we can reasonably assume that actions with a negative advantage were bad while actions with a positive advantage were good. Perfect -- now that we have a way to evaluate each action, we are ready to train our first agent using policy gradients. Let's see how."

    "In the early 20th century, the mathematician Andrey Markov studied stochastic processes with no memory, called *Markov chains*. Such a process has a fixed number of states, & it randomly evolves from one state to another at each step. The probability for it to evolve from a state *s* to a state *s'* is fixed, & it depends only on the pair (*s*, *s'*), not on past states (this is why we say that the system has no memory).\n",

    "Suppose that the process starts in state $s_0$ & there is a 70% change that it will remain in that state in the next step. Eventually, it is bound to leave that state & never come back because no other state points back to $s_0$. If it goes to state $s_1$, it will then most likely go to state $s_2$ (90% probability), then immediately back to state $s_1$ (with 100% probability). It may alternate a number of times between these two states, but eventually it will fall into state $s_3$ & remain there forever (this is a *terminal state). Markov chanins can have very different dynamics, & they are heavily used in thermodynamics, chemistry, statistics, & much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markove decision processes were first described in the 1950s by Richard Bellman. They resemble Markov chains but with a twist: at each step, an agent can choose one of several possible actions, & the transition probabilities depend on the chosen action. Moreover, some state transitions return some reward (positive or negative), & the agent's goal is to find a policy that will maximise reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the MDP represented below has three states (represented by circles) & up to three possible discrete actions at each step (represented by diamonds).\n",

    "If it starts in state $s_0$, the agent can choose between actions $a_0$, $a_1$, & $a_2$. If it chooses action $a_1$, it just remains in state $s_0$ with certainty, & without any reward. It can thus decide to stay there forever if it wants to. But if it chooses action $a_0$, it has a 70% chance of gaining a reward +10 & remaining in state $s_0$. It can then try again & again to gain as much rewards as possible, but at one point it is going to end up instead in state $s_1$. In state $s_1$, it has only two possible actions: $a_0$ or $a_2$. It can choose to stay put by repeatedly choosing action $a_0$, or it can choose to moove on to state $s_2$ & get a negative reward of -50 (ouch). In state $s_2$, it has no other choice than to take action $a_1$, which will most likely lead it back to state $s_0$ gaining a reward of +40 on the way. You get the picture. By looking at this MDP, can you guess which strategy will give the most reward over time? In state $s_0$, it is clear that action $a_0$ is the best option, & in state $s_2$, the agent has no choice but to take action $a_1$, but in state $s_1$ it is not obvious whether the agent should stay put ($a_0$) or go through the fire ($a_2$).\n",

He showed that if the agent acts optimally, then the *Bellman Optimality Equation* applies.

Luckily, Bellman found a very similar algorithm to estimate the optimal *state-action values*, generally called *Q-values* (Quality Values). The optimal Q-value of the state-action pair ($s$, $a$), noted $Q^*(s, a)$ is the sum of discounted future rewards the agent can expect on average after it reaches the state $s$ & chooses action $a$, but before it sees the outcome of this action, assuming it acts optimally after that action.\n",

Conversely, the policy gradients algorithm is an *on-policy* algorithm: it explores the world using the policy being trained. It is somewhat surprising the Q-learning is capable of learning the optimal policy by just watching an agent act randomly (imagine learning to play golf when your teacher is a drunk monkey).

    "Of course, Q-learning can work only if the exploration policy explores the MDP throughly enough. Although a purely random policy is guaranteed to visit every state & every transition many times, it may take an extremely long time to do so. Therefore, a better option is to use the *$\\varepsilon$-greedy policy* ($\\varepsilon$ is epsilon): at each step it acts randomly with probability $\\varepsilon$, or greedily with probability 1 - $\\varepsilon$ (i.e., chooisng the action with the highest Q-value). The advantage of the $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy (compared to a random policy) is that it will spend more & more time exploring the interesting parts of the environment, as the Q-value estimates get better & better, while still spending some time visiting unknown regions of the MDP. It is quite common to start with a high value for $\\varepsilon$ (e.g., 1.0) & then gradually reduce it (e.g., down to 0.05).\n",

    "The solution is to find a function $Q_{\\theta}(s, a)$ that approximates the Q-value of any state-action pair ($s$, $a$) using a manageable number of parameters (given by the parameter vector $\\theta$). This is called *approximate Q-learning$. For years, it was recommended to use linear combinations of handcrafted features extracted from the state (e.g., distance of the closest ghosts, their directions, & so on) to estimate Q-values, but in 2013, DeepMind showed that using deep neural networks can work much better, especially for complex problems, & it does not require any feature engineering. A DNN used to estimate Q-values is called a *deep Q-network* (DQN), & using a DQN for approximate Q-learning is called *deep Q-learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can we train a DQN? Well, consider the approximate Q-value computed by the DQN for a given state-action pair ($s$, $a$). Thanks to Bellman, we know we want this approximate Q-value to be as close as possible to the reward $r$ that we actually observe after playing action $a$ in state $s$, plus the discounted value of playing optimally from tehn on. To estimate this sum of future discounted rewards, we can simply execute the DQN on the next state $s'$ & for all possible actions $a'$. We get an approximate future Q-value for each possible action. We then pick the highest (since we assume we will be playing optimally) & discount it, & this gives us an estimate of the sum of future discounted rewards. By summing the reward $r$ & the future discounted value estimate, we get a target Q-value $y(s, a)$ for the state-action pair ($s$, $a$), as shown below:\n",

Specifically, we generally try to minimise the squared error between the estimated Q-value $Q(s, a)$ & the target Q-value (or the Huber loss to reduce the algorithm's sensitivity to large errors). That's all for the basic deep Q-learning algorithm! Let's see how to implement it to solve the cartpole environment."

However, the DQN will also output the Q-values for the other possible actions, not just for the action that was actually chosen by the agent. So we need to mask out all the Q-values we do not need. The `tf.one_hot()` function makes it easy to convert an array of action indices into such a mask. For example, if the first three experiences contains actions 1, 1, 0, respectively, then the mask will start with `[[0, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0], ...]`. We can then multiply the DQN's output with this mask, & this will zero out all the Q-values we do not want. We then sum over axis 1 to get rid of all the zeros, keeping only the Q-values of the experienced state-action pairs. This gives us the `Q_values` tensor, containing one predicted Q-value for each experience in the batch.\n",

Then we call the `play_one_step()` function, which will use the $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy to pick an action, then execute it & record the experience in the replay buffer. If the episode is done, we exit the loop. Finally, if we are past the 50th episode, we call the `training_step()` function to train the model on one batch sampled from the replay buffer.

That's great news: the algorithm worked fine, & it actually ran much faster than the policy gradient algorithm! But wait... just a few episodes later, it forgot everything it knew, & its performance dropped below 25!. This is called *catastrophic forgetting*, & it is one of the big problems facing virtually all RL algorithms: as the agent explores the environment, it updates its policy, but what it learns in one part of the environment may break what it learned earlier in other parts of the environment. The experiences are quite correlated, & the learning environment keeps changing -- this is not ideal for gradient descent. If you increase the size of the replay buffer, the algorithm will be less subject to this problem. Reducing the learning rate may also help. But the truth is, reinforcement is hard: training is often unstable, & you may need to try many hyperparameter values & random seeds before you find a combination that workswell. For example, if you try changing the number of neurons per layer in the preceding from 32 to 30 or 34, the performance will never go above 100 (the DQN may be more stable with one hidden layer instead of two).\n",

The loss might go down, yet the agent might perform worse (e.g., this can happen when the agent gets stuch in one small region of the environment, & the DQN starts overfitting this region). Conversely, the loss could go up,yet the agent might perform better (e.g., if the DQN was underestimating the Q-values, & it starts correctly increasing its predictions, the agent will likely perform better, getting more rewards, but the loss might increase because the DQN also sets the targets, which will be larger too).\n",

To stabilise training, they used a tiny learning rate of 0.00025, they updated the target model only every 10,000 steps (instead of the 50 in the previous code example), & they used a very large replay buffer of 1 million experiences.

The update was based on the observation that the target network is prone to overestimating Q-values. Indeed, suppose all actions are equally good: the Q-values estimated by the target model should be identical, but since they are approximations, some may be slightly greater than others, by pure chance. The target model will always select the largest Q-value, which will be slightly greater than themean Q-value, most likely overestimating the true Q-value (a bit like counting the height of the tallest random wave when measuring the depth of a pool). To fix this, they proposed using the online model instead of the target model when selecting the best actions for the next states, & using the target model only to estimate the Q-values for these best actions.

    "\n",
    "Instead of sampling experiences *uniformly* from the replay buffer, why not sample important experiences more frequently? This idea is called *importance sampling* (IS) or *prioritised experience replay* (PER), & it was introduced in a 2015 paper by DeepMind researchers (once again!).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specificially, experiences are considered \"important\" if they are likely to lead to fast learning progress. But how can we estimate this? One reasonable approach is to measure the magnitude of the TD error $\\sigma = r + \\gamma * V(s') - V(s)$. A large TD error indicates that a transitiont ($s$, $r$, $s'$) is very surprising, & thus probably worth learning from. When an experience is recorded in the replay buffer, its priority is set to a very large value, to ensure that it gets sampled at least once. However, once it is sampled (& every time it is sampled), the TD error $\\sigma$ is computed, & this experience's priority is set to $p = |\\sigma|$ (plus a small constantto ensure that every experience has a non-zero probability of being sampled). The probability P of sampling an expereince with priority $p$ is proportional to $p^{\\zeta}$, where $\\zeta$ is a hyperparameter that controls how greedy we want importance sampling to be: when $\\zeta = 0$, we just get uniform sampling, & when $\\zeta = 1$, we get full-blown importance sampling. In the paper, the authors used $\\zeta = 0.6$, but the optimal value will depend on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one catch, though: since the samples will be biased toward important experiences, we must compensate for this bias during training by downweighting the experiences according to their importance, or else the model will just overfit the important experiences. To be clear, we want important experiences to be sampled more often, but this also means we must give them a lower weight during training. TO do this, we define each experience's training weight as $w = (nP)^\\beta$, where $n$ is the number of experiences in the replay buffer, & $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls how much we wan to compensate for the importance sampling bias (0 means not at all, while 1 means entirely). In the paper, the authors used $\\beta = 0.4$ at the beginning of training & linearly increased it to $\\beta = 1$ by the end of training. Again, the optimal value will depend on the task, but if you increase one, you will usually want to increase the other as well. \n",

    "Now let's look at one last important variant of the DQN algorithm\n",

    "\n",
    "The *Dueling DQN* algorithm (DDQN, not to be confused with Double DQN, although both techniques can easily be combined) was introduced in yet another 2015 paper by DeepMind researchers. To understand how it works, we must first note that the Q-value of a state-action pair ($s$, $a$) can be expressed as $Q(s, a) = V(s) + A(s, a)$, where $V(s)$ is the value of state $s$ & $A(s, a)$ is the *advantage* of taking the action $a$ in state $s$, compared to all other possible actions in that state. Moreover, the value of a state is equal to the Q-value of the best action $a^*$ for that state (since we assume the optimal policy will pick the best action), so $V(s) = Q(s, a^*)$, which implies that $A(s, a^*) = 0$. In a dueling DQN, the model estimates both the value of the state & the advantage of each possible action. Since the best action should have an advantage of 0, the model subtracts the maximum predicted advantage from all predicted advantages. Here is a simple dueling DQN model, implemented using the functional API:"

    "For Atari environments, some standard preprocessing steps are applied in most papers that use them, so TF-agents provides a handy `AtariPreprocessing` wrapper that implements them. Here is the list of preprocessing steps it supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Grayscale & downsampling*\n",
    "   - Observations are converted to grayscale & downsampled (by default to 84 x 84 pixels)\n",
    "* *Max pooling*\n",
    "   - The last two frames of the game are max-pooled using a 1 x 1 filter. This is to remove the flickering that occurs in some Atari games due to the limited number of sprites that the Atari 2600 could display in each frame.\n",
    "* *Frame skipping*\n",
    "   - The agent only gets to see every *n* frames of the game (by default *n* = 4), & its actions are repeated for each frame, collecting all the rewards. This effectively speeds up the game from the perspective of the agent, & it also speeds up training because rewards are less delayed.\n",
    "* *End on life lost*\n",
    "   - In some games, the rewards are just based on the score, so the agent gets no immediate penalty for losing a life. One solution is to end the game immediately whenever a life is lost. There is some debate over the actual benefits of this strategy, so it is off by default.\n",
    " \n",
    "Since the default Atari environment already applies random frame skipping & max pooling, we will need to load the raw nonskipping variant called `\"BreakoutNoFrameskip -v4\"`. Moreover, a single frame from teh `Breakout` game is insufficient to know the direction & speed of the ball, which will make it very difficult for the agent to play the game properly (unless it is an RNN agent, which preserves some internal state between steps). One wayto handle this is to use an environment wrapper that will output observations composed of multiple frames stacked on top of each other along the channel dimension. This strategy is implemented by the `FrameStack4` wrapper, which returns stacks of four frames. Let's create the wrapped Atari environment!"

Instead of exploring a single environment, you generally want to the driver to explore multiple copies of the environment in parallel, taking advantage of the power of all your CPU cores, keeping the training GPUs busy, & providing less-correlated trajectories to the training algorithm.\n",
    "* What is a *trajectory*? It is a concise representation of a *transition* from one time step to the next, or a sequence of consecutive transitions from time step *n* to time step *n + t*. The trajectories collected by the driver are passed to the observer, which saves them in the replay buffer, & they are later sampled by the agent & used for training.\n",
    "* Why do we need an observer? Can't the driver save the trajectories directly? Indeed, it could, but this would make the architecture less flexible. For example, what if you don't want to use a replay buffer? What if you want to use the trajectories for something else, like computing metrics? In fact, an observer is just any function that takes a trajectory as an argument. You can use an observer to save the trajectories to a replay buffer, or to save them to a TFRecord file, or to compute the metrics, or for anything else. Moreover, you can pass multiple observers to the driver, & it will broadcase the trajectories to all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will create all these components: first the deep Q-network, then the DQN agent (which will take care of creating the collect policy), then the replay buffer & te observer to write to it, then a few training metrics, then the driver, & finally the dataset.

The observations contain unsigned bytes, which use 4 times less space than 32-bit floats, which is why we did not cast the observations to 32-bit floats earlier; we want to save RAM in the replay buffer. Next, the network applies three convolutional layers: the first has 32 8 x 8 filters & uses a stride of 4, the second has 64 4 x 4 filters & a stride of 2, & the third has 64 3 x 3 filters & a stride of 1.

Stateful policies return their own state in the action step, along with the chosen action. The driver will then pass this state back to the policy at the next time step. Moreover, the driver saves the policy state to the trajectory (in the `policy_info` field), so it ends up in the replay buffer. This is essential when training a stateful policy: when the agent samples a trajectory, it must set the policy's state tot eh state it was in at the time of the sampled time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as discussed earlier, the environment may be a batched environment, in which case the driver passes a *batched time step* to the policy (i.e., a time step object containing a batch of observations, a batch of step types, a batch of rewards, & a batch of discounts, all four batches of the same size). The driver also passes a batch of actions & a batch of policy states. Finally, the driver creates a *batched trajectory* (i.e., a trajectory containing a batch of step types, a batch of observations, a batch of actions, a batch of rewards, & more generally a batch for each trajectory attribute, with all batches of the same size).\n",

This explains why the shape of the `observation` field is [2, 3, 84, 84, 4]: that's two trajectories, each with three steps, & each step's observation is 84 x 84 x 4. Similarly, the `step_type` tensor has a shape of [2, 3]: in this example, both trajectories contain three consecutive steps in the middle on an episode (types 1, 1, 1). In the second trajectory, you can barely see the ball at the lower left of the first observation, & it disappears in the next two observations, so the agent is about to lose a life, but the episode will not end immediately because it still has several lives left.\n",

To avoid this duplication, the $n^{th}$ trajectory step includes only the type & observation from time step *n* (not its reward & discount), & it does not contain the observation from time step *n* + 1 (however, it does contain a copy of the next time step's type; that's the only duplication).\n",

    "# Overview of Some Popular RL Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Before finishing this lesson, let's take a quick look at a few popular RL algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Actor-Critic algorithms*\n",
    "   - A family of RL algorithms that combine policy gradients with deep Q-networks. An actor-critic agent contains two neural networks: a policy net & a DQN. The DQN is trained normally, by learning from the agent's experiences. The policy net learns differently (& much faster) than in regular PG: instead of estimating the value of each action by going through multiple episodes, then summing the future discounted rewards for each action, & finally normalising them, the agent (actor) relies ont eh action values estimated by the DQN (critic). It's a bit like an athlete (agent) learning with the help of a coach (DQN).\n",
    "* *Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic* (A3C)\n",
    "   - An important actor-critic variant introduced by DeepMind researchers in 2016, where multiple agents learn in parallel, exploring different copies of the environment. At regular intervals, but asynchronously (hence the name), each agent pushes some weight updates to a master network, then it pulls the latest weights from that network. Each agent thus contributes to improving the master network & benefits from what the other agents have learned. Moreover,instead of estimating Q-values, the DQN estimates the advantage of each action (hence the second A in the name), which stabilises training.\n",
    "* *Advantage Actor-Critic* (A2C)\n",
    "   - A variant of the A3C algorithm that removes the asynchronicity. All model updates are synchronous, so gradient updates are performed over larger batches, which allows the model to better utilise the power of the GPU.\n",
    "* *Soft Actor-Critic* (SAC)\n",
    "   - An actor-critic variant proposed in 2018 by Tuomas Haarnoja & other UC Berkely researchers. It learns not only rewards, but also to maximise the entropy of its actions. In other words, it tries to be as unpredictable as possible whil still getting as many rewards as possible. This encourages the agent to explore the environment, which speeds up training & makes it less likely to repeatedly execute the same action when the DQN produces imperfect estimates. This algorithm has demonstrated an amazing sample efficiency (contrary to all the previous algorithms, which learn very slowly). SAC is available in TF-agents.\n",
    "* *Proximal Policy Optimisation* (PPO)\n",
    "   - An algorithm based on A2C that clips the loss function to avoid excessively large weight updates (which often leads to training instabilities). OpenAI made the news in April 2019 with their AI called Open AI Five, based on the PPO algorithm, which defeated the world champions at the multiplayer game *Dota 2*. PPO is also available in tf-agents.\n",
    "* *Curiousity-based exploration*\n",
    "   - A recurring problem in RL is the sparsity of the rewards, which makes learning very slow & inefficient. Deepak Pathak & other UC Berkeley researchers have proposed an exciting way to tackle this issue: why not ignore the rewards, & just make the agent extremely curious to explore the environment? The rewards thus become intrinsic to the agent, rather than coming from the environment. Similarly stimulating curiousity in a child is more likely to give good results than purely rewarding the child for getting good grades. How does this work? The agent continuously tries to predict the outcome of its actions, & it seeks situations where the outcome does not match its predictions. In other words, it wants to be surprised. If the outcome is predictable (boring), it goes elsewhere. However, if the outcome is unpredictable but the agent notices that it has no control over it, it also get bored after a while. With only curiosity, the authors succeeded in training an agent at many video games: even though the agents get no penalty for losing, the game starts over, which is boring so it learns to avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered many topics in this lesson: policy gradients, Markov chains, Markov decision processes, Q-learning, approximate Q-learning, & deep Q-learning & its main variants (fixed Q-value targets, double DQN, dueling DQN, & prioritised experience replay). We discussed how to use tf-agents to train agents at scale, & finally we took a quick look at a few other popular algorithms. Reinforcement learning is a huge & exciting field, with new ideas & algorithms popping out every day, so I hope this chapter sparked your curiosity: there is a whole world to explore!"
