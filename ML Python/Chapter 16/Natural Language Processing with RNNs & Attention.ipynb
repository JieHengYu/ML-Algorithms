    "# Natural Language Processing with RNNs & Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alan Turing  imagined his famous Turing test in 1950, his objective was to evaluate a machine's ability to match human intelligence. He could have tested for many things, such as the ability to recognise cats in pictures, play chess, compose music, or escapea maze, but interestingly, he chose a linguistic task. More specifically, he devised a *chatbot* capable of fooling its interlocutor into thinking it was human. This test does have its weaknesses: a set of hardcoded rules can fool unsuspecting or naive humans (e.g., the machine could give vague predefined answers in response to some keywords; it could pretend that it is joking or drunk, to get a pass on its weirdest answers; or it could escape difficult questions by answering them with its otwn questions), & many aspects of human intelligence are utterly ignored (e.g., the ability to interpret nonverbal communication such as facial expressions, or to learn a manual task). But the test does highlight the fact that mastering language is arguably *Homo sapien*'s greated cognitive ability. Can we build a machine that can read & write natural language?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach for natural language tasks is to use recurrent neural networks. We will therefore continue to explore RNNs, starting with a *character* RNN, trained to predict the next character in a sentence. This will allow us to generate some original text, & in the process, we will see how to build a tensorflow dataset on a very long sequence. We will first use a *stateless* RNN (which learns on random portions of text at each iteration, without any information on the rest of the text), then we will build a *stateful* RNN (which preserves the hidden state between training iterations & continues reading where it left off, allowing it to learn longer patterns). Next, we will build a RNN to perform sentiment analysis (e.g., reading movie reviews & extracting the rater's feelings about the movie), this time treating sentences as sequences of words, rather than characters. Then we will show how RNNs can be used to build an encoder-decoder architecture capable of performing neural machine translation (NMT). For this, we will use the seq2seq API provided by the TensorFlow addons project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this lesson, we will look at *attention* mechanisms. As their name suggests, these are neural network components that learn to select the part of the inputs that the rest of the model should focus on at each time step. First, we will see how to boost the performance of an RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture using attention, then we will drop RNNs altogether & look at very successful attention-only architecture called the *transformer*. Finally, we will take a look at some of the most important advances in NLP, including incredibly powerful language models such as GPT-2 & BERT, both based on transformers.\n",

    "Before we continue, we need to split the dataset into a training set, a validation set, & a test set. We can't just shuffle all the characters in the text, so how do you split a sequential dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Split a Sequential Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to avoid any overlap between the training set, the validation set, & the test set. For example, we can take the first 90% of the text for the training set, then the next 5% for the validation set, & the final 5% for the text set. It would also be a good idea to leave a gap between these sets to avoid the risk of a paragraph overlapping over two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with time series, you would in general split across time: for example, you might take years 2000 to 2012 for the training set, the years 2013 to 2015 for the validation set, & the years 2016 to 2018 for the test set. However, in some cases, you may be able to split along other dimensions, which will give you a longer time period to train on. For example, if you have data about the financial health of 10,000 companies from 2000 to 2018, you might be able to split this data across the different companies. It's very likely that many of these companies will be strongly correlated, though (e.g., whole economic sectors may go up or down jointly), & if you have correlated companies across the training set & the test set, your test set will not be as useful, as its measure of the generalisation error will be optimistically biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is often safer to split across time -- but this implicitly assumes that the patterns the RNN can learn in the past (in the training set) will still exist in the future. In other words, we assume that the time series is *stationary* (at least in a wide sense). For many time series, this assumption is reasonable (e.g., chemical reactions should be fine, since the laws of chemistry don't change every day), but for many other it is not (e.g., financial markets are notoriously not stationary since patterns disappear as soon as traders spot them & start exploiting them). To make sure the time series is indeed sufficiently stationary, you can plot the model's errors on the validation set across time: if the model performs much better on the first part of the validation set than on the last part, then the time series may not be stationary enough, & you might be better off training the model on a shorter time span.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, splitting a time series into a training set, a validation set, & a test set is not a trivial task, & how it's done will depend strongly on the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",

Ever instance in the dataset will be a fairly short substrings of the whole text, & the RNN will be unrolled only over the length of these substrings. This is called *truncated backpropagation through time*. Let's call the `window()` method to create a dataset of short text windows."

To ensure that all windows are exactly 101 characters long (which will allow us to create batches without having to do any padding), we set `drop_remainder = True` (otherwise the last 100 windows will contain 100 chracters, 99 chracters, & so on down to 1 character).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `window()` method creates a dataset that contains windows, each of which is also represented as a dataset. It's a *nested dataset* analogous to a list of lists. This is useful when you want to transform each window by calling its dataset methods (e.g., to shuffle them or batch them). However, we cannot use a nested dataset directly for training, as our model will expect tensors as input, not datasets. So we must call the `flat_map()` method: it converts a nested dataset into a *flat dataset* (one that does not contain datasets). For example, suppose {1, 2, 3} represented a dataset containing the sequence of tensors 1, 2, & 3. If you flatten the nested dataset {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}}, you will get back the flat dataset {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Moreover, the `flat_map()` method takes a function as an argument, which allows you to transform each dataset in the nested dataset before flattening. For example, if you pass the function `lambda ds: ds.batch(2)` to `flat_map()`, then it will transform the nested dataset {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}} into the flat dataset {[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]}: it's a dataset of tensors of size 2.

    "Apparently, our Shakespeare model works best at a temperature close to 1. To generate more convicing text, you could try using more `GRU` layers & more neurons per layer & train for longer, & add more regularisation by increasing dropout rate in the `GRU` layers. Moreover the model is currently incapable of learning patterns longer than `n_steps`, which is just 100 characters. You could try making this window larger, but it will also make training harder, & even LSTM & GRU cells cannot handle very long sequences. Alternatively, you could use a stateful RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stateful RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have used only *stateless RNNs*: at each training iteration, the model starts with a hidden state full of zeros, then it updates this state at each time step, & after the last time step, it throws it away, as it is not needed anymore. What if we told the RNN to preserve this final state after processing one training batch & use it as the initial state for the next training batch? This way the model can learn long-term patterns despite only backpropagating through short sequences. This is called a *stateful RNN*. Let's see how to build one.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that a stateful RNN only makes sense if each input sequence in a batch starts exactly where the corresponding sequence in the previous batch left off. So the first thing we need to do to build a stateful RNN is to use sequential & nonoverlapping input sequences (rather than the shuffled & overlapping sequences we used to train stateless RNNs). When creating the `Dataset`, we must therefore use `shift = n_steps` (instead of `shift = 1`) when calling the `window()` method. Moreover, we must obviously *not* call the `shuffle()` method. Unfortunately, batching is much harder when preparing a dataset for a stateful RNN than it is for a stateless RNN. Indeed, if we were to call `batch(32)`, then 32 consecutive windows would be put in the same batch, & the following batch would not continue each of these window where it left off. The first batch would contain windows 1 to 32 & the second batch would contain windows 33 to 64, so if you consider, say, the first window of each batch (i.e., windows 1 & 33), you can see that they are not consecutive. The simplest solution to this problem is to just use \"batches\" containing a single window:"

    "In a real project, you will have to preprocess the text yourself. You can do that using the same `Tokenizer` class we used earlier, but this time setting `char_level = False` (which is the default). When encoding words, it filters out a lot of characters, including most punctuation, line breaks, & tabs (but you can change this by setting the `filters` argument). Most importantly, it uses spaces to identify word boundaries. This is ok for English & many other scripts (written languages) that use spaces between words, but not all scripts use spaces this way. Chinese does not use spaces between words, Vietnamese uses spaces even within words, & languages such as German often attach multiple words together, without spaces. Even in English, spaces are not always the best way to tokenize text: think of \"San Francisco\" or \"#ILoveDeepLearning\".\n",

    "Fortunately, there are better options. The 2018 paper by Taku Kudo introduced an unsupervised learning technique to tokenise & detokenise text at the subword level in a language-independent way, treating spaces like other characters. With this approach, even if your model encounters a word it has never seen before, it can still reasonably guess what it means. For example, it may never have seen the word \"smartest\" during training, but perhaps it learned the word \"smart\" & it also learned that the suffix \"est\" means \"the most\", so it can infer the meaning of \"smartest\". Google's sentencepiece project provides an open source implementation, described in a paper by Taku Kudo & John Richardson.\n",

The embedding matrix needs to have one row per word ID (`vocab_size` + `num_oov_buckets`) & one column per embedding dimension (this example uses 128 dimensions, but this is a hyperparameter you can tune). Whereas the inputs of the model will be 2D tensors of shape [*batch size*, *time steps*], the output of the `Embedding` layer will be a 3D tensor of shape [*batch size*, *time steps*, *embedding size*].\n",

    "As it stands, the model will need to learn that the padding tokens should be ignored. But we already know that! Why don't we tell the model toignore the padding tokens, so that it can focus on the data that actually matters? It's actually trivial: simply add `mask_zero = True` when creating the `Embedding` layer creates a *mask tensor* equal to `K.not_equal(inputs, 0)` (where `K = keras.backend`): it is a boolean tensor with the same shape as the inputs, & it is equal to `False` anywhere the word IDs are 0, or `True` otherwise. This mask tensor is then automatically propagated by the model to all subsequent layers, as long as the time dimension is preserved. So in this example, both `GRU` layers will receive this mask automatically, but since the second `GRU` layer does not return sequences (it only returns the output of the last time step), the mask will not be transmitted to the `Dense` layer. Each layer may handle the mask differently, but in general, they simply ignore masked time steps (i.e., time steps for which the mask is `False`). For example, when a recurrent layer encounters a masked time step, it simply copies the output from the previous time step. If the mask propagates all the way to the output (in models that output sequences, which is not the case in this example), then it will be applied to the losses as well, so the masked time steps will not contribute to the loss (their loss will be 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "All layers that receive the mask must support masking (or else an exception will be raised). This includes all recurrent layers, as well as the `TimeDistributed` layer & a few other layers. Any layer that supports masking must have a `supports_masking` attribute equal to `True`. If you want to implement your own custom layer with masking support, you should add a `mask` argument to the `call()` method (& obviously make the method use the mask somehow). Additionally, you should set `self.supports_masking = True` in the constructor. If your layer does not start with an `Embedding` layer, you may use the `keras.layers.Masking` layer instead: it sets the mask to `K.any(K.not_equal(inputs, 0), axis = -1)`, meaning that time steps where the last dimension is full of zeros will be masked out in subsequent layers (again, as long as the time dimension exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using masking layers & automatic mask propagation works best for simple `Sequential` models. It will not always work for more complex models, such as when you need to mix `Conv1D` layers with recurrent layers. In such cases, you will need to explicitly compute the mask & pass it to the appropriate layers, using either the functional API or the subclassing API. For example, the following model is identical to the previous model, except it is built using the functional API & handles masking manually:"

    "After training for a few epochs, this model will become quite good at judging whether a review is positive or not. If you use the `TensorBoard()` callback, you can visualize the embeddings in tensorboard as they are being learned: it is fascinating to see words like \"awesome\" & \"amazing\" gradually cluster on one side of the embedding space, while words like \"awful\" & \"terrible\" cluster on the other side. Some words are not as positive as you might expect (at least with this model), such as the word \"good\", presumably because many negative reviews contain the phrase \"not good\". It's impressive that the model is able to learn useful word embeddings based on just 25,000 movie reviews. Imagine how good the embeddings would be if we had billions of reviews to train on! Unfortunately, we don't, but perhaps, we can reuse word embeddings trained on some other large text corpus (e.g., wikipedia articles) even if it is not composed of movie reviews? After all, the word \"amazing\" generally has the same meaning whether or not you use it to talk about movies or anything else. Moreover, perhaps embeddings would be useful for sentiment analysis even if they were trained on another task: since words like \"awesome\" & \"amazing\" have a similar meaning, they will likely cluster in the embedding space even for other tasks (e.g., predicting the next word in a sentence). If all positive words & all negative words form clusters, then this will be helpful for sentiment analysis.

    "\n",
    "In short, the english sentences are fed to the encoder, & the decoder outputs the french translations. Note that the french translations are also used as inputs to the decoder, but shifted back by one step. In other words, the decoder is given as input the word that it *should* have output at the previous step (regardless of what it actually output). For the very first word, it is given the start-of-sequence (SOS) token. The decoder is expected to end the sentence with an end-of-sequence (EOS) token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the english sentences are reverse before they are fed to the encoder. For example, \"I drink milk\" is reversed to \"milk drink I\". This ensures that the beginning of the english sentences will be fed last to the encoder, which is useful because that's generally the first thing that the decoder needs to translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word is initially represented by its ID (e.g., 288 for the word \"milk\"). Next, an `embedding` layer returns the word embedding. These word embeddings are what is actually fed to the encoder & the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the decoder outputs a score for each word in the output vocabulary (i.e., French), & then the softmax layer turns these scores into probabilities. For example, at the first step, the word \"Je\" may have a probability of 20%, \"Tu\" may have a probability of 1%, & so on. The word with the highest probability is the output. This is very much like a regular classification task, so you can train the model using the `\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\" loss, much like we did in the char-RNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that at inference time (after training), you will not have the target sentence to feed to the decoder. Instead, simply feed the decoder the word that it output at the previous step (this will require an embedding lookup that is now shown in the below diagram).\n",

    "\n",
    "* So far, we have assumed that all input sequences (to the encoder & to the decoder) have a constant length. But obviously, sentence lengths vary. Since regular tensors have fixed shapes, they can only contain sequences of the same length. You can use masking to handle this, as discussed earlier. However, if the sentences have very different lengths, you can't just crop them like we did for sentiment analysis (because we want full translations, not cropped translations). Instead, group sentences into buckets of similar lengths (e.g., a bucket for the 1- to 6-word sentences, another for the 7- to 12- word sentences, & so on), using padding for the shorter sequences to ensure all sentences in a bucket have the same length (check out the `tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length()` function for this). For example, \"I drink milk\" becomes \"\\<pad> \\<pad> \\<pad> milk drink I\".\n",
    "* We want to ignore any output past the EOS token, so these tokens should not contribute to the loss (they must be masked out). For example, if the model outputs \"Je bois du lait \\<eos> oui\", the loss for the last word should be ignored.\n",
    "* When the output vocabulary is large (which is the case here), outputting a probability for each & every possible word would be terribly slow. If the target vocabulary contains, say 50,000 french words, then the decoder would output 50,000-dimensional vectors, & then computing the softmax function over such a large vector would be very computationally intensive. To avoid this, one solution is to look only at the logits output by the model for the correct word & for a random sample of incorrect words, then compute an approximation of the loss based only on these logits. This *sampled softmax* technique was introduced in 2015 by Sebastien Jean et al. In TensorFlow, you can use the `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss()` function for this during training & use the normal softmax function during inference time (sampled softmax cannot be used at inference time because it required knowing the target).\n",

    "The code is mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few points to note. First, we set `return_state = True` when creating the `LSTM` layer so that we can get its final hidden state & pass it to the decoder. Since we are using an LSTM cell, it actually returns two hidden state (short term & long term). The `TrainingSampler` is one of several samplers available in TensorFlow addons: their role is to tell the decoder at each step what it should pretend the previous output was. During inference, this should be the embedding of the token that was actually output. During training, it should be the embedding of the previous target token: this is why we used the `TrainingSampler`. In practice, it is often a good idea to start training with the embedding of the target of the previous time step & gradually transition to using the embedding of the actual token that was output at the previous step. This idea was introduced in a 2015 paper by Samy Bengio et al. The *ScheduleEmbeddingTrainingSampler` will randomly choose between teh target or the actual output, with a probability that you can gradually change during training.\n",

    "At each time step, a regular recurrent layer only looks at past & present inputs before generating its output. In other words, it is \"causal\", meaning it cannot look into the future. This type of RNN makes sense when forecasting time series, but for many NLP tasks, such as neural machine translation, it is often preferable to look ahead at the next words before encoding a given word. For example, consider the phrases \"the queen of the United Kingdom\", \"the queen of hearts\" & \"the queen bee\": to properly encode the word \"queen\", you need to look ahead. To implement this, run two recurrent layers on the same inputs, one reading the words from left to right & the other reading them from right to left. Then simple combine their outputs at each time step, typically by concatenating them. This is called a *bidirectional recurrent layer*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you train an encoder-decoder model & use it to transalte the french sentence \"Comment vas-tu?\" to english. You are hoping that it will output the proper translation (\"How are you?\"), but unfortunately, it outputs \"How will you?\" Looking at the training set, you notice many sentences such as \"Comment vas-tu jouer?\" which translates to \"How will you play?\" So it wasn't absurd for the model to output \"How will\" after seeing \"Comment vas\". Unfortunately, in this case it was a mistake & the model could not go back & fix it, so it tried to complete the sentence as best it could. By greedily outputting the most likely word at every step, it ended up with a suboptimal translation. How can we give the model a chance to go back & fix mistakes it made earlier? One of the most common solutions is *beam search*: it keeps track of a short list of the *k* most promising sentences (say, the top three), & at each decoder step it tries to extend them by one word, keeping only the *k* most likely sentences. The parameter *k* is called the *beam width*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you use the model to translate the sentence \"Comment vas-tu?\" using beam search with a beam width of 3. At the first decoder step, the model will output an estimated probability for each possible word. Suppose the top three words are \"How\" (75% estimated probability), \"What\" (3%), & \"You\" (1%). That's our short list so far. Next, we create three copies of our model & use them to find the next word for each sentence. Each model will output one estimated probability per word in the vocabulary. The first model will try to find the next word in the sentence \"How\", & perhaps it will output a probability og 36% for the word \"will\", 32% forthe word \"are\", 16% for the word \"do\", & so on. Note that these are actually *conditional* probabilities, given that the sentence starts with \"How\". The second model will try to complete the sentence \"What\"; it might output a conditional probability of 50% for the word \"are\", & so on. Assuming the vocabulary has 10,000 words, each model will output 10,000 probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we compute the probabilities of each of the 30,000 two-wrod sentences that these models considered (3 x 10,000). We do this by multiplying the estimated conditional probability of each word by the estimated probability of the sentence it completes. For example, the estimated probability of the sentence \"How\" was 75%, while the estimated conditional probability of the word \"will\" (given that the first word is \"How\") was 36%, so the estimated probability of the sentence \"How will\" is 75% x 36% = 27%. After computing the probabilities of all 30,000 two-word sentences, we keep only the top 3. Perhaps they all start with the word \"How\": \"How will\" (27%), \"How are\" (24%), & \"How do\" (12%). Right now, the sentence \"How will\" is winning, but \"How are\" has not been eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we repeat the same process: we use three models to predict the next word in each of these three sentences, & we compute the probabilities of all 30,000 three-word sentences we considered. Perhaps the top three are now \"How are you\" (10%), \"How do you\" (8%), & \"How will you\" (2%). At the next step we may get \"How do you do\" (7%), \"How are you \\<eos>\" (6%), & \"How are you doing\" (3%). Notice that \"How will\" was eliminated, & we now have three perfectly reasonable translations. We boosted our encoder-decoder model's performance without any extra training, simply by using it more wisely.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the path from the word \"milk\" to its translation \"lait\" in the simple machine translation model: it is quite long! This means that a representation of this word (along with all the other words) needs to be carried over many steps before it is actually used. Can't we make this path shorter?  This was the core idea in a groundbreaking 2014 paper by dzmitry bahdanau et al. They introduced a technique that allowed the decoder to focus on the appropriate words (as encoded by the encoder) at each time step. For example, at the time step where the decoder needs to output the word \"lait\", it will focus its attention on the word \"milk\". This means that the path from an input word to its translation is not much shorter, so the short-term memory limitations of RNNs have much less impact. Attention mechanisms revolutionalised neural machine trnaslation (& NLP in general), allowing a significant improvement in the state of the art, especially for long sentences (over 30 words).\n",

Instead of just sending the encoder's final hidden state to the decoder (which is still done, although it is not shown in the figure), we now send all of its outputs to the decoder. At each time step, the decoder's memory cell computes a weighted sum of all these encoder outputs: this determines which words it will focus on at this step. The weight $\\alpha_{(t, i)}$ is the weight of the $i^{th}$ encoder output at the $t^{th}$ decoder time step. For example if the weight $\\alpha_{(3, 2)}$ is much larger than the weights $\\alpha_{(3, 0)}$ & $\\alpha_{(3, 1)}$, then the decoder will pay much more attention to word number 2 (\"milk\") than to the other two words, at least at this time step. The rest of the decoder works just like earlier: at each time step, the memory cell receives the inputs we just discussed, plus the hidden state from the previous time step, & finally (although it is not represented in the diagram) it receives the target word from the previous time step (or at inference time, the output from the previous time step).\n",
    "\n",
    "But where do these $\\alpha_{(t, i)}$ weights come from? It's actually pretty simple: they are generated by a type of small neural network called an *alignment model* (or an *attention layer*), which is trained jointly with the rest of the encoder-decoder model. This alignment model is illustrated on the righthand side of the above figure. It starts with a time-distributed `Dense` later with a single neuron, which receives as input all the encoder outputs, concatenated with the decoder's previous hidden state (e.g., $h_{(2)}$). This layer outputs a score (or energy) for each encoder output (e.g., $e_{(3, 2)}$): this score measures how well each output is aligned with the decoder's previous hidden state. Finally, all the scores go through a softmax layer to get a final weight for each encoder output (e.g., $\\alpha_{(3, 2)}$). All weights for a given decoder time step add up to 1 (since the softmax layer is not time-distributed). This particular attention mechanism is called *Bahdanau attention* (named after the paper's first author). Since it concatenates the encoder output with the decoder's previous hidden state, it is sometimes called *concatenative attention* (or *additive attention*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common attention mechanism was proposed shortly after, in a 2015 paper by Minh-Thang Luong et al. Because the goal of the attention mechanism is to measure the similarity between one of the encoder's outputs & the decoder's previous hidden state, the authors proposed to simply compute the *dot product* of these two vectors, as this is often a fairly good similarity measure, & modern hardware can compute it much faster. For this to be possible, both vectors must have the same dimensionality. This is called *Luong attention* (again, after the paper's first author), or sometimes called *multiplicative attention*. The dot product gives a score, & all the scores (at a given decoder time step) go through a softmax layer to give the final weights, just like Bahdanau attention. Another simplification they proposed was to use the decoder's hidden state at the current time step rather than at the previous time step (i.e.,, $h_{(t)}$ rather than $h_{(t - 1)}$), then to use the output of the attention mechanism (noted $\\tilde{h}_{(t)}$) directly to compute the decoder's predictions (rather than using it to compute the decoder's current hidden state). They also proposed a variant of the dot product mechanism where the encoder outputs first go through a linear transformation (i.e., a time-distributed `Dense` layer without a bias term) before the dot products are computed. This is called the \"general\" dot product approach. They compared both dot product approaches to the concatenative atttention mechanism (adding a rescaling parameter $v$), & they observed that the dot product variants performed better than concatenative attention. For this reason, concatenative attention is much less used now. The equations for these three attention mechanisms are summarise below:\n",

One of their first applications beyond NMT was in generatin gimage cations using visual attention: a convolutional neural network first processes the image & outputs some feature maps, then a decoder RNN equipped with an attention mechanism generates the caption, one word at a time. At each decoder time step (each word), the decoder uses the attention model to focus on just the right part of the image. For example in the below figure, the model geenrates the caption \"A woman is throwing a frisbee in a park\", & you can see what part of the input image the decoder focused its attention on when it was about to output the word \"frisbee\": clearly, most of its attention was focused on the frisbee.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a groundbreaking 2017 paper, a team of google researcher suggested that \"Attention Is All You Need\". They managed to create an architecture called the *Transformer*, which significantly improved the state of the art in NMT without using any recurrent or convolutional layers, just attention mechanisms (plus embedding layers, dense layers, normalisation layers, & a few other bits & pieces). As an extra bonus, this architecture was also much faster to train & easier to parallelise, so they managed to train it at a fraction of the time & cost of the previous state-of-the-art models.\n",

    "The transformer architecture is represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/Transformer Architecture.png\" width = \"550\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through this figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The lefthand part is the encoder. Just like earlier, it takes as input a batch of sentences represented as sequences of word IDs (the input shape is [*batch size*, *max input sentence length*]), & it encodes each word into a 512-dimensional representation (so the encoder's output shape is [*batch size*, *max input sentence length*, 512]). Note that the top part of the encoder is stacked N times (in the paper, N = 6).\n",
    "* The righthand part is the decoder. During training, it takes the target sentence as input (also represented as a sequence of word IDs), shifted one time step to the right (i.e., a start-of-sequence token is inserted at the beginning). It also receives the outputs of the encoder (i.e., the arrows coming from the left side). Note that the top part of the decoder is also stacked N times, & the encoder's stack final outputs are fed to the decoder at each of these N levels. Just like earlier, the decoder outputs a probability for each possible next word, at each time step (its output shape is [*batch size*, *max output sentence length*, *vocabulary length*]).\n",
    "* During inference, the decoder cannot be fed targets, so we feed it the previously output words (starting with a start-of-sequence token). So the model needs to be called repeatedly, predicting one more word at every round (which is fed to the decoder at the next round, until the end-of-sequence token is output).\n",
    "* Looking more closely, you can see that you are already familiar with most components: there are two embedding layers, 5 * N skip connections, each of them followed by a layer normalisation layer, 2 * N \"Feed Forward\" modules that are composed of two dense layers each (the first one using the ReLU activation function, the second with no activation function), & finally the output layer is a dense layer using the softmax activation function. All of these layers are time-distributed, so each word is treated independently of all the other. But how can we translated a sentence by only looking at one word at a time? Well, that's where the new componenets come in:\n",
    "   - The encoder's *Multi-Head Attention* layer encodes each word's relationship with every other word in the same sentence, paying more attention to the most relevant ones. For example, the output of this layer for the word \"Queen\" in the sentence \"They welcomed the Queen of the United Kingdom\" will depend on all the words in the sentence, but it will probably pay more attention to the words \"United\" & \"Kingdon\" than to the words \"They\" or \"welcomed\". This attention mechanism is called *self-attention* (the sentence is paying attention to itself). We will discuss exactly how it works shortly. The decoder's *Masked Mult-Head Attention* layer does the same thing, but each word is only allowed to attend to words located before it. Finally, the decoder's upper multi-head attention layer is where the decoder pays attention to the words in the input sentence. For example, the decoder will probably pay close attention to the word \"Queen\" in the input sentence when it is about to output this word's translation.\n",
    "   - The *positional embeddings* are simply dense vectors (much like word embeddings) that represent the position of a word in the sentence. This gives the model access to each word's position, which is needed because the multi-head attention layers do not consider the order or the position of the words; they only look at their relationships. Since all the other layers are time-distributed, they have no way of knowing the position of each word (either relative or absolute). Obviously, the relative & absolute word positions are important, so we need to give this information to the transformer somehow, & positional embeddings are a good way to do this.\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's look a bit closer at both these novel components of the transformer architecture, starting with positional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "A positional embedding is a dense vector that encodes the position of a word within a sentence: the $i^{th}$ positional embedding is simply added to the word embedding of the $i^{th}$ word in teh sentence. These positional embeddings can be learned by the model, but in the paper, the authors preferred to use fixed positional embeddings, defined using the sine & cosine functions of different frequencies. The positional embedding matrix $P$ is defined in the below equation, represented in the below figure, where $P_{p, i}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of the embedding for the word located at the $p^{th}$ position in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "P_{p, 2i} = sin(p/10000^{2i/d}) \\\\\n",
    "P_{p, 2i + 1} = cos(p/10000^{2i/d})\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/Positional Embedding Matrix.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution gives the same performance as learned positional embeddings do, but it can extend to arbitrarily long sentences, which is why it's favoured. After the positional embeddings are added to the word embeddings, the rest of the model has access to the absolute position of each word in the sentence because there is a unique positional embedding for each position (e.g., the positional embedding for the word located at the 22nd position in a sentence is represented by the vertical dashed line at the bottom of the above figure, & you can see that it is unique to that position). Moreover, the choice of oscillating function (sine & cosine) makes it possible for the model to learn relative positions as well. For example, words located 38 words apart (e.g., at position p = 22 & p = 60) always have the same positional embedding values in the embedding dimensions i = 100 & i = 101, as you can see in the above figure. This explains why we need both the sine & cosine for each frequency: if we only use sine (the blue wave at i = 100), the model would not be able to distinguish positions p = 25 & p = 35 (marked by a cross).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no `PositionalEmbedding` layer in TensorFlow, but it easy to create on. For efficiency reasons, we precompute the positional embedding matrix in the constructor (so we need to know the maximum sentence length, `max_steps`, & the number of dimensions for each word representation, `max_dims`). Then the `call()` method crops this embedding matrix to the size of the inputs, & it adds it to the inputs. Since we added an extra first dimension of size 1 when creating the positional embedding matrix, the rules of broadcasting will ensure that the matrix gets added to every sentence in the inputs:"

    "Now, let's look deeper into the heart of the transformer model: the multi-head attention layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how a multi-head attention layer works, we must first understand the *scaled dot-product attention* layer, which it is based on. Let's suppose the encoder analysed the input sentence, \"They played chess\", & it managed to understand that the word \"They\" is the subject & the word \"played\" is the verb, so it encoded this information in the representations of these words. Now suppose the decoder has already translated the subject, & it thinks that it should translate the verb next. For this, it needs to fetch the verb from the input sentence. This is analog to a dictionary lookup: it's as if the encoder created a dictionary {\"subject\", \"They\", \"verb\", \"played\", ...} & the decoder wanted to look up the value that corresponds to the key \"verb\". However, the model does not have discrete tokens to represent the keys (like \"subject\" or \"verb\"); it has vectorized representations of these concepts (which it learned during training), so the key it will use for the lookup (called the *query*) will not perfectly match any key in the dictionary. The solution is to compute a similarity measure between the query & each key in the dictionary, & then use a softmax function to convert these similarity scores to weights that add up to 1. If the key that represents the verb is by far the most similar to the query, then the weighted sum will be very close to the representation of the word \"played\". In short, you can think of this whole process as a differentiable dictionary lookup. The similarity measure used by the transformer is just the dot product, like in Luong attention. In fact, the equation is the same as for Luong attention, except for a scaling factor. The equation is shows below in vectorised form.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^{\\intercal}}{\\sqrt{d_{keys}}})V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Q$ is a matrix containing one row per query. Its shape is [$n_{queries}$, $d_{keys}$], where $n_{queries}$ is the number of queries & $d_{keys}$ is the number of dimensions of each query & each key.\n",

    "* $V$ is a matrix containing one row per value. Its shape is [$n_{keys}$, $d_{values}$] where $d_{values}$ is the number of each value.\n",
    "* The shape of $QK^{\\intercal}$ is [$n_{queries}$, $n_{keys}$]: it contains one similarity score for each query/key pair. The output of the softmax function has the same shape, but all rows sum up to 1. The final output has a shape of [$n_{queries}$, $d_{values}$]: there is one row per query, where each row represents the query result (a weighted sum of the values).\n",
    "* The scaling factor scales down the similarity scores to avoid saturating the softmax function, which would lead to tiny gradients.\n",
    "* It is possible to mask out some key/value pairs by adding a very large negative value to the corresponding similarity scores, just before computing the softmax. This is useful in the masked multi-head attention layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder, this equation is applied to every input sentence in the batch, with Q, K, & V all equal to the list of words in the input sentence (so each word in the sentence will be compared to every word in the same sentence, including itself). Similarly, in the decoder's masked attention layer, the equation will be applied to every target sentence in the batch, with $Q$, $K$, & $V$ all equal to the list of words in the target sentence, but this time using a mask to prevent any word from comparing itself words located after it (at inference time the decoder, the keys $K$ & values $V$ are simply the list of word encodings produced by the encoder, & the queries $Q$ are the list of word encodings produced by the decoder.\n",
    "\n",

All the outputs are simply concatenated, & they go through a final linear transformation (again, time-distributed). But why? What is the intuition behind this architecture? Well, consider the word \"played\" we discussed earlier (in the sentence \"They played chess\"). The encoder was smart enough to encode the fact that it is a verb. But the word representation also includes many other feature that are useful for its translation, such as the fact that it is in the past tense. In short, the word representation encodes many different characteristics of the word. if we just used a single scaled dot-product attention layer, we would only be able to query all of these characteristics in one shot. This is why the multi-head attention layer applies multiple different linear transformations of the value, keys, & queries: this allows the model to apply many different projections of the word representation into different subspaces, each focusing on a subset of the word's characteristics. Perhaps one of the linear layers will project the word representation into a subspace where all that remains is the information that the word is a verb, another linear layer will extract just the fact that is past tense, & so on. Then the scaled dot-product attention layers implement the lookup phase, & finally we concatenate all the results & project them back to the original space.\n",

    "* The ELMo paper by Matthew Peters introduced *Embeddings from Language Models* (ELMo): these are contextualised word embeddings learned from the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model.

Their model outperformed the state of the art on six text classification tasks by a large margin (reducing the error rate by 18-24% in most cases). Moreover, they showed that by fine-tuning the pretrained model on just 100 labeled examples, they could achieve the same performance as a model trained from scratch on 10,000 examples.\n",
    "* The GPT paper by Alec Radford & other OpenAI researchers also demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining, but this time using a transformer-like architecture. The authors pretrained a large but fairly simple architecture composed of a stack of 12 transformer modules (using only masked multi-head attention layers) on a large dataset, once again trained using self-supervised learning. Then they fine-tuned it on various language tasks, using only minor adaptations for each task. The tasks were quite diverse: they included text classification, *entailment* (whether sentence A entails sentence B), similarity (e.g., \"Nice weather today\" is very similar to \"It is sunny\"), & question answering (given a few multiple-choice questions). Just a few months layer, in February 2019, Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, & other OpenAI researchers published the GPT-2 paper, which proosed a very similar architecture, but larger still (with over 1.5 billion parameters!) & they showed that it could achieve good performance on many tasks without any fine-tuning. This is called *zero-shot learning* (ZSL). A smaller version of GPT-2 model (with just 115 million parameters) is available at *https://github.openai/gpt-2*, along with its pretrained weights.\n",

This means that the model is naturally bidirectianl; hence the B in Bert (*Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*). Most importantly, the authors proposed two pretraining tasks that explain most of the model's strength:\n",
    "   - *Masked language model* (MLM): each word in a sentence has a 15% probability of being masked, & the model is trained to predict the masked words. For example, if the original sentence is \"She had fun at the birthday party\", then the model may be given the sentence \"She \\<mask> fun at the \\<mask> party\", & it must predict the words \"had\" & \"birthday\" (the other outputs will be ignored). To be more precise, each selected word has an 80% chance of being masked, a 10% chance of being replaced by a random word (to reduce the discrepancy between pretraining & fine-tuning, since the model will not see \\<mask> tokens during fine-tuning), & a 10% chance of beling left alone (to bias the model toward the correct answer).\n",
    "   - *Next sentence prediction* (NSP): The model is trained to predict whether two sentences are consecutive or not. For example, it should predict that \"The dog sleeps\" & \"It snores loudly\" are consecutive sentences, while \"The dog sleeps\" & \"The Earth orbits the Sun\" are not consecutive. This is a challenging task, & it significantly improved the performance of the model when it is fine-tuned on tasks such as question answering or entailment.\n",
    " \n",
    "As you can see, the main innovations in 2018 & 2019 have been better subword tokenisation, shifting from LSTMs to Transformers, & pretraining universal language models using self-supervised learning, then fine-tuning them with very few architectural changes (or none at all). Things are moving fast: no one can say what architectures will prevail next year. Today, it's clearly transformers, but tomorrow it might be CNNs (e.g., check out the 2018 paper by Maha Elbayad et al., where the researchers used masked 2D convolutional layers for sequence-to-sequence tasks). Or it might even be RNNs, if htey make a surprise comeback (e.g., check out the 2018 paper by Shuai Li et al. that shows that by making neurons independent of each other in a given RNN layer, it is possible to train much deeper RNNs capable of learning much longer sequences)."
